/* The issue lies in how calc() handles percentages within a parent container. 
   The percentage is calculated based on the parent container's size, and if there are other units in the calculation,
   the resulting value might not be what you expect.
   Instead of relying on calc() in this case, set explicit dimensions or use other CSS techniques to achieve the desired effect. */
